# API Key Setup

This extension requires an OpenAI API key to function. Create an API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

## Security

We recommend [restricting your API key's access](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8867743-assign-api-key-permissions) to the endpoint that this extension uses (which is currently `chat/completions`).

## Using built-in AI

If you would prefer not to use an API key and are okay with waiting, popular browsers are shipping [built-in AI](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in) models soon. An [experimental version](https://github.com/OveringOwl/jargone-integrated-ai) of JarGone already exists that leverages browser built-in AI, and will be merged once these capabilities ship.
